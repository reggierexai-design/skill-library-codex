# AI RAG Design

## Purpose
- Design retrieval, chunking, freshness, and citation behavior for grounded question answering.
- This is an **AI specialist** for Codex users who need a result that can survive review, handoff, or execution.
- Prefer this skill when a structured operating pass will outperform a generic answer.

## Use when
- Use when answers must rely on evolving source material instead of model memory alone.
- The main bottleneck is best solved through ai work rather than generic brainstorming.
- There is enough context to act, or the first useful move is to identify what is missing.

## Avoid when
- Do not build retrieval before clarifying the corpus, users, and freshness needs.
- Do not use it to add ceremony when a short direct answer would solve the task.
- Stop and re-route if the task crosses into a higher-risk domain than this skill is meant to handle alone.

## Inputs to gather
- Target workflow, users, models, tools, context sources, and failure tolerance.
- Existing prompts, evals, logs, incidents, or product requirements that define the current system.
- What is needed now: system design, routing logic, evals, memory policy, or guardrail review.
- Acceptance threshold: what would make the output ready for use, review, or handoff.

## Operating rules
- Retrieval quality beats vector count.
- Design for freshness, provenance, and fallback behavior.
- Chunk for answerability, not just token size.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations so the operator can see what is proven versus inferred.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient move that improves clarity, decision quality, or execution momentum.
- When context is stale or incomplete, name the gap instead of hiding it inside confident language.

## Codex tool pattern
- Treat agent behavior as a system: prompts, tools, context, memory, evals, and failure handling must agree.
- Read the current prompt, tool schema, examples, and runtime constraints before proposing architecture changes.
- Prefer designs that are testable, observable, and cheap to iterate rather than clever but fragile.
- Keep the workspace state legible: summarize touched files, consulted sources, and checks performed when they materially affect trust.

## Expanded workflow
1. Map user questions and source corpus.
2. Define chunking, retrieval, reranking, and citation behavior.
3. Plan freshness checks and failure handling.
4. Return a practical RAG design with evaluation hooks.
5. Check the draft against the original request and remove anything that does not change the outcome.
6. End with the exact next action, follow-up check, or approval path.

## Output contract
- Question classes
- Retrieval design
- Freshness policy
- Failure and eval plan
- System recommendation, policy, or design doc with clear evaluation hooks.
- Failure modes, guardrails, and the smallest next experiment to de-risk the design.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Trying to solve a systems problem with prompt wording alone.
- Adding retrieval, memory, or tools without a concrete failure mode they must solve.
- Skipping eval design and then guessing whether the change helped.
- Declaring success before the output is usable by the next operator, owner, or decision-maker.

## Handoff cues
- State current status, remaining blockers, and the smallest next move.
- Name the files, pages, systems, or source material that another operator should read first.
- Flag approvals, missing evidence, or live-system access that still require a human decision.

## Example invocation
- Slash: `/ai_rag_design <task>`
- Natural language: "Use aI RAG Design to design retrieval, chunking, freshness, and citation behavior for grounded question answering."
- Example: "Design the agent path so it is testable, safe, and not dependent on luck."
- Example: "Review this prompt or tool system and tell me the real failure modes and fixes."
- Often paired with: `ai_prompt_system`, `ai_eval_harness`, `ai_guardrail_review`

## Quality bar
- A strong RAG design improves trust, not just recall.
- The result should reduce ambiguity or risk, not merely add more words.
- A good pass leaves a clear next action, owner, or verification step.
