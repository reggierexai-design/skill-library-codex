# Context Budget Gate

## Purpose
- Keep a run lean by selecting only the context and skills that change the next decision.
- This is a **core specialist** for Codex users who need a result that can survive review, handoff, or execution.
- Prefer this skill when a structured operating pass will outperform a generic answer.

## Use when
- Use before pulling in many files, tools, or skills for one task.
- The main bottleneck is best solved through core work rather than generic brainstorming.
- There is enough context to act, or the first useful move is to identify what is missing.

## Avoid when
- Do not load broad context just because it exists.
- Do not use it to add ceremony when a short direct answer would solve the task.
- Stop and re-route if the task crosses into a higher-risk domain than this skill is meant to handle alone.

## Inputs to gather
- User objective, scope boundary, deadline, and success condition.
- Known constraints, approvals, and any actions that must stay reversible.
- The smallest set of files, notes, tools, or prior decisions that affect the next move.
- Acceptance threshold: what would make the output ready for use, review, or handoff.

## Operating rules
- Context should be chosen, not inherited by accident.
- Prefer narrow evidence to broad familiarity.
- Cut anything that does not change the next action.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations so the operator can see what is proven versus inferred.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient move that improves clarity, decision quality, or execution momentum.
- When context is stale or incomplete, name the gap instead of hiding it inside confident language.

## Codex tool pattern
- Start by reading the local context that changes the decision instead of front-loading every file.
- Use search/read to map the problem first; only edit or execute after the plan and blast radius are clear.
- Leave a compact reasoning trail so later skills can pick up without repeating discovery work.
- Keep the workspace state legible: summarize touched files, consulted sources, and checks performed when they materially affect trust.

## Expanded workflow
1. List candidate context sources.
2. Keep the few that change the decision.
3. Drop or defer the rest.
4. Return a lean context plan for the run.
5. Check the draft against the original request and remove anything that does not change the outcome.
6. End with the exact next action, follow-up check, or approval path.

## Output contract
- Included context
- Excluded context
- Reasoning
- Next action
- Next action or decision recommendation.
- Dependencies, risks, and the smallest follow-up check that closes the loop.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Planning too much after the next action is already obvious.
- Skipping routing and forcing the wrong specialist to own the work.
- Producing ceremony instead of a decision-ready next step.
- Declaring success before the output is usable by the next operator, owner, or decision-maker.

## Handoff cues
- State current status, remaining blockers, and the smallest next move.
- Name the files, pages, systems, or source material that another operator should read first.
- Flag approvals, missing evidence, or live-system access that still require a human decision.

## Example invocation
- Primary use: internal or autonomous routing when the task pattern matches.
- Natural language: "Use context Budget Gate to keep a run lean by selecting only the context and skills that change the next decision."
- Example: "Route this mixed request and tell me the smallest safe next step."
- Example: "Plan the task, then tell me what context actually matters before we touch files."
- Often paired with: `core_route_request`, `core_plan_task`, `core_verify_done`

## Quality bar
- A good context gate improves focus before work even starts.
- The result should reduce ambiguity or risk, not merely add more words.
- A good pass leaves a clear next action, owner, or verification step.
