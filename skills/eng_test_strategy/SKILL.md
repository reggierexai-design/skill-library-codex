# Test Strategy

## Purpose
- Design the smallest reliable test set that protects the important behavior of the change.
- This is an **engineering specialist** for Codex users who need a result that can survive review, handoff, or execution.
- Prefer this skill when a structured operating pass will outperform a generic answer.

## Use when
- Use when adding, updating, or evaluating tests around new work or a bug fix.
- The main bottleneck is best solved through engineering work rather than generic brainstorming.
- There is enough context to act, or the first useful move is to identify what is missing.

## Avoid when
- Do not use to justify massive test suites with weak signal.
- Do not use it to add ceremony when a short direct answer would solve the task.
- Stop and re-route if the task crosses into a higher-risk domain than this skill is meant to handle alone.

## Inputs to gather
- Target system, repo area, environment, and the concrete failure, change, or performance goal.
- Relevant files, logs, tests, stack traces, commands, and deployment constraints.
- Definition of done: fix, refactor, review, migration plan, or release-safety decision.
- Acceptance threshold: what would make the output ready for use, review, or handoff.

## Operating rules
- Test the behavior that matters most to users and future maintenance.
- Prefer a balanced mix of fast, focused checks and a small number of integration proofs.
- Do not duplicate the implementation inside the test.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations so the operator can see what is proven versus inferred.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient move that improves clarity, decision quality, or execution momentum.
- When context is stale or incomplete, name the gap instead of hiding it inside confident language.

## Codex tool pattern
- Scout the repo before editing; read the nearest implementation, tests, and docs that define current behavior.
- Use minimal diffs, bounded commands, and targeted verification instead of broad speculative changes.
- When code is touched, explain what changed, why it is safe, and how it was verified.
- Keep the workspace state legible: summarize touched files, consulted sources, and checks performed when they materially affect trust.

## Expanded workflow
1. Define the risks introduced or addressed by the change.
2. Pick the minimum tests that cover those risks.
3. Name what will not be tested and why.
4. Write or recommend the tests in project-native style.
5. Check the draft against the original request and remove anything that does not change the outcome.
6. End with the exact next action, follow-up check, or approval path.

## Output contract
- Risk list
- Recommended test cases
- Chosen test level
- Coverage gaps
- Implementation note, review note, or fix plan tied to specific files and checks.
- Verification evidence, remaining risks, and rollback or next-step notes when relevant.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Patching symptoms without proving the cause or expected behavior.
- Bundling unrelated cleanup into a debugging or release task.
- Stopping after the code compiles without checking the user-visible outcome.
- Declaring success before the output is usable by the next operator, owner, or decision-maker.

## Handoff cues
- State current status, remaining blockers, and the smallest next move.
- Name the files, pages, systems, or source material that another operator should read first.
- Flag approvals, missing evidence, or live-system access that still require a human decision.

## Example invocation
- Slash: `/eng_test_strategy <task>`
- Natural language: "Use test Strategy to design the smallest reliable test set that protects the important behavior of the change."
- Example: "Use this before editing code so we touch the minimum safe surface."
- Example: "Review the change and tell me what could break, not just what looks nice."
- Often paired with: `eng_repo_onboarding`, `eng_minimal_patch`

## Quality bar
- The best test plan is small, sharp, and trusted.
- The result should reduce ambiguity or risk, not merely add more words.
- A good pass leaves a clear next action, owner, or verification step.
