# Data Pipeline Triage

## Purpose
- Triage broken or delayed data flows by isolating the failing stage and recovery options.
- This is a **data specialist** for Codex users who need a result that can survive review, handoff, or execution.
- Prefer this skill when a structured operating pass will outperform a generic answer.

## Use when
- Use when scheduled data jobs, transformations, or reports are failing or late.
- The main bottleneck is best solved through data work rather than generic brainstorming.
- There is enough context to act, or the first useful move is to identify what is missing.

## Avoid when
- Do not rewrite the whole pipeline during active triage.
- Do not use it to add ceremony when a short direct answer would solve the task.
- Stop and re-route if the task crosses into a higher-risk domain than this skill is meant to handle alone.

## Inputs to gather
- Business question, metric definitions, time windows, segments, and source systems involved.
- Known anomalies, dashboard complaints, experiment context, or instrumentation limits.
- What level of confidence is needed before a decision is made from the analysis.
- Acceptance threshold: what would make the output ready for use, review, or handoff.

## Operating rules
- Contain impact before optimizing architecture.
- Identify the first failing stage, not every downstream symptom.
- Separate data correctness from freshness.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations so the operator can see what is proven versus inferred.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient move that improves clarity, decision quality, or execution momentum.
- When context is stale or incomplete, name the gap instead of hiding it inside confident language.

## Codex tool pattern
- Lock definitions before comparing numbers; many data disagreements are really definition disagreements.
- Inspect lineage, joins, filters, and freshness assumptions before trusting a chart or query output.
- Return the smallest analysis or instrumentation change that increases confidence in the decision.
- Keep the workspace state legible: summarize touched files, consulted sources, and checks performed when they materially affect trust.

## Expanded workflow
1. Map the pipeline stages and the current failure.
2. Locate the first broken handoff or dependency.
3. Propose the safest recovery path.
4. Return recovery steps plus hardening ideas.
5. Check the draft against the original request and remove anything that does not change the outcome.
6. End with the exact next action, follow-up check, or approval path.

## Output contract
- Affected pipeline stage
- Likely cause
- Recovery plan
- Hardening ideas
- Decision-oriented analysis plan, readout, or instrumentation recommendation.
- Definition notes, caveats, and the next check needed to trust the result.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Analyzing a metric whose definition is still moving.
- Explaining a number shift without ruling out pipeline or instrumentation breakage.
- Returning dashboards or queries that look busy but do not answer the actual question.
- Declaring success before the output is usable by the next operator, owner, or decision-maker.

## Handoff cues
- State current status, remaining blockers, and the smallest next move.
- Name the files, pages, systems, or source material that another operator should read first.
- Flag approvals, missing evidence, or live-system access that still require a human decision.

## Example invocation
- Slash: `/data_pipeline_triage <task>`
- Natural language: "Use data Pipeline Triage to triage broken or delayed data flows by isolating the failing stage and recovery options."
- Example: "Turn this vague data question into a trustworthy analysis path."
- Example: "Tell me whether the problem is real behavior, bad instrumentation, or a reporting artifact."
- Often paired with: `data_analysis_plan`, `data_metric_definition`, `data_anomaly_triage`

## Quality bar
- A good pipeline triage shortens downtime without creating a second outage.
- The result should reduce ambiguity or risk, not merely add more words.
- A good pass leaves a clear next action, owner, or verification step.
